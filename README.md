SQL Injection

In this section, I will explain what SQL injection is, describe some common examples, explain how to find and
exploit various kinds of SQL injection vulnarabilities, and show you how to prevent SQL injections.

what is an SQL Injection?

SQL injection is a vulnarability that allows an attacker to interfere and disrupt queries within a database.
This usally alllows the attacker to veiw data they normally would not be able to see. This data that the
attacker can see now is compromised because they can now make changes to the application that can disrupt the 
applications behavior.
